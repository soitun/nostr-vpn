usage: scripts/mobile-test-kit.sh [rust|fast|simulator|device]

Modes:
  rust       Run shared Rust mobile/core tests only.
  fast       Run Rust tests plus Android and iOS debug builds.
  simulator  Run fast checks, then iOS simulator and Android adb launch smokes.
  device     Run opt-in local physical-device VPN/TUN smokes.

Device identifiers are intentionally not stored in the repo. Use environment
variables such as NVPN_ANDROID_SERIAL and NVPN_IOS_DEVICE when needed, or copy
.env.mobile.example to .env.mobile.local for local ignored values. Device mode
builds/installs the exact current iOS development-signed app and uses local iOS
Packet Tunnel coverage without a private invite fixture by default.
Android --vpn-cycle validates the app-private Rust runtime-state file after the
OS VPN network becomes active; tune with NVPN_ANDROID_RUNTIME_STATE_WAIT_SECS
or NVPN_ANDROID_RUNTIME_STATE_MAX_AGE_SECS if a slow device needs it. It also
requires tunPacketsRead to increase after a small shell ping burst; disable only
for device images without ping via NVPN_ANDROID_TUN_PACKET_PROBE=0. The Android
artifacts include normalized ping, TUN packet, and VPN link-counter summaries.

Set NVPN_FIPS_REPO_PATH=/path/to/fips when testing mobile Rust code against
unreleased local FIPS crates. Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock are restored after
local-FIPS cargo runs so platform iteration does not leave workspace churn
behind.

Simulator mode verifies app build/install/launch. Real VPN dataplane checks
need physical devices. Device mode uses debug-created local networks for OS
VPN/TUN coverage without private peer fixtures: Android may tap the system VPN
consent prompt on a trusted local test device, and iOS builds/installs the
current development-signed app before launch, requiring local signing env.
