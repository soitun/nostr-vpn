# iOS Native Shell

Target shell: SwiftUI with NetworkExtension Packet Tunnel integration.

Responsibilities:

- bind to `nostr-vpn-app-core` through the shared JSON C ABI
- render `UiState` with native SwiftUI navigation and sheets
- dispatch `NativeAppAction` values into the shared Rust core
- own platform effects such as share sheets, deep links, Packet Tunnel permission/control, and later Keychain plus live camera QR scanning
- keep iPhone simulator capability differences visible through runtime capabilities

The parity checklist is in `docs/native-ui-parity-matrix.md`.

## Build

```bash
just ios-build
```

The build task cross-compiles `nostr-vpn-app-core` for iOS simulator and device
static libraries, creates an xcframework, generates the Xcode project with
XcodeGen, and builds the app for the iOS simulator.

## Run

```bash
just ios-run
```

## Smoke

```bash
just ios-smoke
```

The simulator smoke verifies build, install, launch, and screenshot capture. Use
`NVPN_IOS_DEVICE=<device-id> just ios-smoke-device` or
`scripts/mobile-ios-smoke.sh device --device <device-id> --vpn-cycle --create-network`
for the physical-device VPN permission and Packet Tunnel path; keep local device
identifiers out of git. A passing physical VPN cycle asks the debug app to
disconnect afterwards unless `--leave-vpn-active` is set. The packet probe target,
port, count, and wait can be overridden with `NVPN_IOS_TUN_PACKET_PROBE_*`.

The native shell includes SwiftUI state/action surfaces, invite QR,
copy/share/import, roster, routing, settings, diagnostics, deep links, app icon,
and Packet Tunnel integration backed by the shared Rust core.
