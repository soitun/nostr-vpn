# Mobile Test Kit

Mobile coverage is split by what each layer can prove.

## Shared Rust

Run this when touching mobile state, FFI, config, reconnect, roster, or FIPS
handoff behavior:

```sh
just mobile-test-kit-rust
```

These checks belong in `nostr-vpn` because the mobile apps call
`nostr-vpn-app-core`. Plain `fips` should keep protocol, routing, session,
candidate, and cross-target Rust tests platform-neutral; real Android/iOS VPN
behavior depends on the `nostr-vpn` shells, permissions, FFI, and packet tunnel
integration.

## Build Smoke

Run the normal fast kit before handing off a mobile-sensitive change:

```sh
just mobile-test-kit
```

This runs shared Rust tests, builds the Android debug APK, and builds the iOS
simulator/device xcframework path. It catches JNI/C ABI drift, missing mobile
targets, and Xcode/Gradle project breakage.

## Simulator And Emulator Smoke

Run this when UI, launch, deep-link, or mobile packaging behavior changed:

```sh
just mobile-test-kit-sim
```

The iOS simulator can verify build, install, launch, state/action UI, and
screenshot capture. It cannot prove the NetworkExtension packet tunnel or VPN
permission path. Android emulator or attached-device smoke verifies APK install
and launch; use `NVPN_ANDROID_SERIAL` or `ANDROID_SERIAL` when more than one adb
target is online.

## Physical Device VPN Smoke

Run this after VPN dataplane, reconnect, LAN discovery, roster transfer, or
mobile tunnel config changes:

```sh
NVPN_ANDROID_SERIAL=<adb-serial> just android-smoke-vpn
NVPN_IOS_DEVICE=<device-id> just ios-smoke-device
```

The iOS device command assumes a development build is already installed and uses
debug launch arguments to cycle the VPN state. Android installs the debug APK and
uses the debug action extra, then checks that both `NostrVpnService` and an
Android VPN network become active. Fresh Android installs need private seeded
state first, for example `NVPN_ANDROID_DEBUG_INVITE=<invite>` or
`NVPN_ANDROID_DEBUG_WIREGUARD_CONFIG_FILE=<ignored-local-file>`. Device
identifiers, signing teams, local hostnames, IP addresses, and personal names
must stay in environment variables, local shell history, or ignored files.
