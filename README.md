## Overview

`nostr-vpn` is a Rust workspace for a Tailscale-style private mesh VPN built around a [FIPS]-backed data plane. It includes the `nvpn` CLI/daemon, a shared native app core, and native platform shells.

Current benchmarks put the [FIPS] data plane around userspace WireGuard-level
throughput, with platform- and topology-specific variance. See
[`docs/EXPERIMENTS.md`](docs/EXPERIMENTS.md) for the raw bench notes.

It currently ships:

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `nvpn` | Main CLI for config, daemon lifecycle, networking, diagnostics, and tunnel sessions |
| `nostr-vpn-core` | Shared library for config, [FIPS] control state, NAT helpers, diagnostics, and MagicDNS |
| `nostr-vpn-app-core` | Native app state/action contract and UniFFI bridge used by the Rust-core/native-front rewrite |
| `macos` | SwiftUI/AppKit native shell over `nostr-vpn-app-core` |
| `linux` | GTK/libadwaita native shell over the shared app core |
| `windows` | WPF native shell and installer over the shared app core |
| `android` / `ios` | Native mobile shells with shared Rust state/action and packet-tunnel scaffolding |
| `umbrel` | Umbrel app package with a web control panel and daemon container |

## Getting Started

Install the CLI from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install nvpn
```

Create a local identity/config, then share or import an invite:

```bash
nvpn init
nvpn create-invite
nvpn import-invite 'nvpn://invite/...'
```

Start a foreground tunnel session:

```bash
nvpn start --connect
```

For the background daemon flow used by the desktop apps:

```bash
nvpn start --daemon --connect
nvpn status
nvpn stop
```

For persistent startup through the OS service manager:

```bash
sudo nvpn service install
nvpn service status
```

On Windows, run `nvpn service install` from an elevated shell instead of using
`sudo`.

## Protocol

For the current protocol-level description of invites, admin roster sync, and the [FIPS] mesh data plane, see [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md).

Private mesh traffic defaults to [FIPS]. `nvpn` uses the configured VPN participants as the overlay route map, but [FIPS] connectivity is a separate underlay: [FIPS] peers can be found through Nostr discovery or supplied as configured `fips_peer_endpoints`, and those [FIPS] peers may relay packets even when they are not members of the same VPN. Direct UDP/NAT failure can fall back through established [FIPS] neighbors, while `nvpn` still only admits private traffic for the active network roster.

## Platform status

| Platform | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| Apple Silicon macOS | Native SwiftUI/AppKit desktop app, signed/notarized release artifacts when credentials are configured, CLI tarball |
| Linux x64 | Native GTK/libadwaita desktop app packaged as `.deb`, CLI tarballs for x86_64 and arm64, Docker e2e coverage |
| Windows x64 | Native WPF desktop app installer, batched WinTun tunnel path, native WireGuard-upstream routing, CLI zip |
| Android arm64 | Native app-core UI, signed APK/AAB release artifacts when signing is configured, VPN runtime still being hardened |
| iOS | Native SwiftUI app builds/runs from source and simulator, NetworkExtension target exists, [TestFlight link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/jPRVxbSv) exists but public beta access is pending |
| Umbrel | Web control panel and daemon package tested on umbrelOS; app-store submission bundle generated from a pinned multi-arch container image |
| Intel macOS | Source-only |

## What the project does today

- Generates Nostr identity keys automatically
- Stores a single app config with one or more named networks, each with participant allowlists and its own stable mesh ID
- Brings up [FIPS] private mesh tunnels for private network traffic
- Routes private [FIPS] traffic directly when possible and through [FIPS] neighbors when direct discovery fails
- Tracks [FIPS] peer/link state and NAT-discovered public endpoints
- Supports route advertisement and exit-node selection
- Supports WireGuard upstream configs for local egress and exit-node providers on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Exposes JSON status, network diagnostics, and doctor bundles
- Includes native macOS and Linux GUIs with service-first session control, invite QR/import flows, tray/menu-bar integration, MagicDNS controls, health reporting, and port-mapping status
- Includes a native Windows WPF shell with tray integration, installer packaging, and the same shared app-core action/state contract
- Includes LAN invite broadcast/discovery, CLI self-update, desktop updater e2e coverage, and Linux-focused Docker e2e coverage for [FIPS] mesh formation, NAT traversal, routed UDP, safe MTU, and WireGuard upstream egress

## Config model

By default, `nvpn` uses the OS config directory:

- Linux: `~/.config/nvpn/config.toml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/nvpn/config.toml`
- Fallback when no config dir is available: `./nvpn.toml`

`nvpn init` creates that file if it does not exist and generates keys automatically.

The config contains:

- global app settings such as autoconnect, tray behavior, and MagicDNS suffix
- Nostr settings used by [FIPS] discovery, including relay URLs and identity keys
- NAT settings including STUN servers and discovery timeout
- node settings including endpoint, tunnel IP, listen port, and advertised routes
- a `[[networks]]` list of named participant sets with one active network at a time

Each `[[networks]]` entry carries its own `network_id`, which is the mesh identity used for roster scope and auto-derived tunnel addressing. If an older config still only has the legacy top-level default, `nostr-vpn` promotes it into per-network stable IDs and then stops recomputing them on participant changes.

Nodes that should talk to each other must share the same `network_id` and list each other as participants. Only the active network participates in the live runtime; inactive networks stay saved for later activation.

## Build and validate

Prerequisites:

- Rust stable
- OS permissions to create tunnel interfaces when running real sessions
- On Linux Docker e2e: Docker with Compose and `/dev/net/tun`

The normal Rust gate is:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Additional automation:

- `.github/workflows/windows-smoke.yml` can manually build the Windows CLI on `windows-latest`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes CLI archives plus native macOS, Linux, Windows, and Android app artifacts when signing/package credentials are configured
- `scripts/local-release.mjs` builds local release artifacts and stages a hashtree-style release directory that can be published to `releases/nostr-vpn`
- `just release-gate` also runs version sync, CLI update e2e, routed-[FIPS] Docker e2e, and safe-MTU Docker e2e

### StartOS package

The StartOS package entrypoint lives in [`startos`](startos) and builds the
same daemon + web-control-panel container used by the Umbrel package.

```bash
npm install
npm run check
npm run build
make
```

`make` requires the StartOS `start-cli` tooling and emits architecture-specific
`.s9pk` files for x86_64 and aarch64.

StartOS package details:

- Image and runtime: local Docker build from [`umbrel/Dockerfile`](umbrel/Dockerfile);
  the runtime image contains `nvpn`, `nostr-vpn-web`, and the compiled web UI.
- Volume layout: the `main` volume is mounted at `/data`; config is stored under
  `/data/config/nvpn`, and home/runtime state is under `/data/home`.
- Network access: one HTTP UI interface is exported through StartOS as `Web UI`;
  the internal web service listens on port 38080 on the StartOS container
  interface only, so it is meant to be opened through StartOS rather than
  directly over Nostr VPN.
- Actions: no custom StartOS actions are currently exposed.
- Backups: the `main` volume is included in StartOS backups.
- Health checks: StartOS checks the `nvpn` daemon process and the web health
  endpoint at `/api/health`.
- Dependencies: none.
- Limitations: the service needs tunnel-device access from StartOS; the manifest
  enables the runtime flag that exposes `/dev/net/tun`.

Quick reference:

```yaml
package_id: nostr-vpn
architectures: [x86_64, aarch64]
volumes:
  main: /data
ports:
  ui: 38080

  - HOME
  - XDG_CONFIG_HOME
  - RUST_LOG
  - NVPN_CLI_PATH
  - NVPN_DAEMON_STATUS_MODE
  - NVPN_EXTERNAL_DAEMON
actions: []
```

### Umbrel app

The Umbrel package lives in [`umbrel`](umbrel). It runs a web control panel
behind Umbrel's app proxy and a separate daemon container with host networking
and `/dev/net/tun`.

```bash
docker compose -f umbrel/docker-compose.local.yml up --build
just e2e-umbrel-web
```

Official Umbrel App Store submissions require a remote, pinned multi-arch
container image. Generate the app-store bundle with:

```bash
node scripts/umbrel-release.mjs \
  --push \
  --image-repo ghcr.io/mmalmi/nostr-vpn-umbrel
```

The added Umbrel screenshots are in [`docs/images`](docs/images).

### Local release

Typical flow:

```bash
cp .env.release.example .env.release.local
$EDITOR .env.release.local
just release-publish
```

Notes:

- `.env.release.local` is local-only and gitignored
- the script auto-loads `.env.release.local` when present
- shell environment variables override values from those files
- on Apple Silicon macOS it can build the native macOS app/CLI locally and Windows CLI/installer artifacts through a reachable Windows VM
- Linux release artifacts include the native `.deb` package and musl CLI tarball
- Windows VM selection can be forced with `NVPN_WINDOWS_VM_NAME`; otherwise the script auto-detects a single running Windows guest
- by default it runs the same sync/version, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, update, and Docker release-gate steps as the release workflow
- staged local release notes include the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section for the release tag, so update `CHANGELOG.md` before publishing
- omit `--publish` if you only want staged release metadata under the local temp directory

### Native macOS App

Build the native app for this machine:

```bash
just build
```

For macOS specifically, `just build` runs `just macos-build`.
After a successful build, it prints the app output path.

Launch the native macOS shell:

```bash
just run
```

If you only want the CLI and test binaries:

```bash
cargo build -p nvpn
```

## Install `nvpn`

Latest releases publish CLI archives for Apple Silicon macOS, Windows x64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64. The quick installer below auto-detects only Apple Silicon macOS and Linux:

```bash
case "$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)" in
  Darwin/arm64) ASSET=nvpn-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz ;;
  Linux/x86_64) ASSET=nvpn-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz ;;
  Linux/aarch64|Linux/arm64) ASSET=nvpn-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz ;;
  Darwin/x86_64)
    echo "No prebuilt Intel macOS release is currently published. Build from source or use an older release." >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unsupported platform: $(uname -s)/$(uname -m)" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/mmalmi/nostr-vpn/releases/latest/download/${ASSET}" | tar -xz && cd nvpn && ./install.sh
```

That command supports Apple Silicon macOS and Linux. On Intel macOS it exits with a clear message. The installer creates the target directory when needed and defaults to `/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple Silicon macOS when that location exists or is already in `PATH`; otherwise it uses `/usr/local/bin`.

The quick-install line currently downloads from the GitHub mirror until a verified `releases/nostr-vpn/latest` tree is published on hashtree. `htree release publish` already maintains the `latest` alias automatically; the missing step is publishing the release tree and verifying the public `upload.iris.to/<npub>/releases/nostr-vpn/latest/...` paths.

On Windows, download the `nvpn-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` release asset and run `nvpn.exe`, or build from source.

From crates.io:

```bash
cargo install nvpn
```

From source:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/nostr-vpn-cli --bin nvpn
```

`cargo install nvpn` installs the published CLI/daemon binary. The path-based
command is useful when developing from a checkout and remains the supported
route on Intel macOS until prebuilt release archives cover that target.

If you already have a release tarball, extract it and run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

You can also pass a custom destination directory, for example `./install.sh ~/.local/bin`.

## CLI quickstart

Create or refresh config and generate keys:

```bash
nvpn init \
  --participant npub1...alice \
  --participant npub1...bob
```

Adjust persisted settings if needed:

```bash
nvpn set \
  --endpoint 192.0.2.10:51820 \
  --listen-port 51820 \
  --fips-advertise-endpoint true \
  --fips-peer-endpoint npub1...bob=192.0.2.11:51820 \
  --tunnel-ip 10.44.0.10/32
```

Run a full foreground session:

```bash
nvpn start --connect
```

Daemonized flow used by native desktop apps:

```bash
nvpn start --daemon --connect
nvpn pause
nvpn resume
nvpn stop
```

For persistent privileged startup:

```bash
sudo nvpn service install
nvpn service status
```

On Windows, run `nvpn service install` from an elevated shell instead of using `sudo`.

The service implementation targets:

- macOS via `launchd`
- Linux via `systemd`
- Windows via the Service Control Manager (`sc.exe`)

`nvpn service enable` / `nvpn service disable` are currently implemented only on macOS. On Linux and Windows, `install` / `uninstall` handle the persistent service lifecycle directly.

Inspect runtime state:

```bash
nvpn status --json
nvpn doctor --json
```

Write a support bundle:

```bash
nvpn doctor --write-bundle /tmp/nvpn-doctor
```

Advertise routes or use an exit node:

```bash
nvpn set --advertise-routes 10.0.0.0/24,192.168.0.0/24
nvpn set --advertise-exit-node true
nvpn set --exit-node npub1...peer
```

Use a WireGuard upstream for the local device:

```bash
nvpn set --wireguard-exit-enabled true --wireguard-exit-config-file ./wg.conf
```

If this device should also serve as a mesh exit node, enable both:

```bash
nvpn set --advertise-exit-node true --wireguard-exit-enabled true
```

Members still see this as the same [FIPS] exit node; the provider's own default
internet route and forwarded member exit traffic both use the WireGuard
upstream.

Clear exit-node selection:

```bash
nvpn set --exit-node off
```

Lower-level commands:

- `init`
- `version`
- `update`
- `install-cli`
- `uninstall-cli`
- `service`
- `start`
- `stop`
- `repair-network`
- `reload`
- `pause`
- `resume`
- `connect`
- `status`
- `set`
- `create-invite`
- `import-invite`
- `invite-broadcast`
- `discover`
- `add-participant`
- `remove-participant`
- `add-admin`
- `remove-admin`
- `ping`
- `doctor`
- `ip`
- `whois`
- `wg-upstream-test`

## Native Apps

Native app work is split into a Rust-owned state/action core and platform shells.

The native UI rewrite parity target is tracked in [`docs/native-ui-parity-matrix.md`](docs/native-ui-parity-matrix.md).
The shared native app contract lives in [`crates/nostr-vpn-app-core`](crates/nostr-vpn-app-core), with native shell targets under [`macos`](macos), [`windows`](windows), [`linux`](linux), [`android`](android), and [`ios`](ios).
The local native shell can be built with `just build` and launched with `just run`.
Use `just run-macos` or `just run-linux` when you want a specific desktop target.

Notes:

- desktop shells use the installed/bundled `nvpn` binary for privileged service/session work
- mobile shells share the Rust app contract and platform packet-tunnel scaffolding while the full mobile data-plane path is still being hardened
- the legacy Tauri/Svelte app was removed after the native rewrite became the canonical architecture

## Docker end-to-end coverage

Run the focused security regression kit:

```sh
just security-regressions
```

Docker e2e scripts under [`scripts/`](scripts):

- `./scripts/e2e-docker.sh`
  Verifies static [FIPS] peer configuration, mesh formation, and tunnel ping.
- `./scripts/e2e-connect-docker.sh`
  Verifies config-driven `nvpn connect`, [FIPS] mesh formation, and tunnel ping.
- `./scripts/e2e-active-network-docker.sh`
  Verifies that inactive saved networks do not change the active mesh identity, expected peer count, or auto-derived tunnel IP.
- `./scripts/e2e-divergent-roster-docker.sh`
  Verifies that peers with a shared mesh ID can still connect when one node has extra configured participants.
- `./scripts/e2e-fips-routed-udp-docker.sh`
  Verifies that peers can move tunnel payloads through a [FIPS] neighbor when their direct UDP path is blocked.
- `./scripts/e2e-fips-nat-safe-mtu-docker.sh`
  Verifies safe-MTU traffic across a NAT-shaped [FIPS] mesh path.
- `./scripts/e2e-exit-node-docker.sh`
  Verifies exit-node advertisement, selection, tunnel traffic to the chosen exit node, and default-route traffic crossing the exit path to an external target. Set `NVPN_EXIT_NODE_E2E_PUBLIC_IP=9.9.9.9` (or another reachable public IP) to also prove a real internet hop routes through the tunnel.
- `./scripts/e2e-wireguard-exit-docker.sh`
  Verifies WireGuard-upstream egress and guards against upstream-initiated ingress into nvpn peers, including a hostile upstream route for the mesh tunnel range.
- `./scripts/e2e-wireguard-exit-userspace-docker.sh`
  Verifies the standalone userspace WireGuard-upstream probe, scoped-host route, and guarded default-route replacement.

These flows are Linux-oriented because they require real tunnel devices and container networking privileges.

## Desktop update end-to-end coverage

Desktop updater scripts under [`scripts/`](scripts):

- `./scripts/e2e-update-desktop.sh`
  Runs the macOS app updater path, Linux GTK updater path in Docker, and Windows WPF updater path in a Parallels VM.
- `./scripts/e2e-update-macos.sh`
  Builds the macOS app, checks a local release manifest, downloads a fake `.app.tar.gz`, and verifies the app bundle can be unpacked.
- `./scripts/e2e-update-linux.sh`
  Runs the Linux app in the Docker dev image, checks a local release manifest, downloads the selected AppImage, and verifies it is executable.
- `./scripts/e2e-update-windows-vm.sh`
  Runs `scripts/e2e-update-windows.ps1` inside the Windows VM, builds the WPF app, checks a local release manifest, and verifies the selected setup executable downloads.
- `./tools/run-windows`
  On macOS, builds and runs the Windows app inside the running Parallels Windows VM. The macOS host is not expected to have PowerShell or .NET installed.

The update E2E scripts set `NVPN_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL` to a local fixture and suppress opening installers/packages, so they test update selection and download/install preparation without touching production release storage.

## Workspace layout

- [`Cargo.toml`](Cargo.toml): workspace definition
- [`crates/nostr-vpn-core`](crates/nostr-vpn-core): shared config, [FIPS] control state, diagnostics, MagicDNS, and NAT helpers
- [`crates/nostr-vpn-cli`](crates/nostr-vpn-cli): `nvpn` CLI and daemon implementation
- [`crates/nostr-vpn-app-core`](crates/nostr-vpn-app-core): native app state/action contract and UniFFI bridge
- [`macos`](macos), [`linux`](linux), [`windows`](windows), [`android`](android), [`ios`](ios): native platform shells
- [`scripts`](scripts): build, release, Docker e2e, and desktop updater e2e entrypoints

## Release workflow notes

Release workflow ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)):

- runs on pushed `v*` tags or manual dispatch
- verifies sync-versions, formatting, clippy, Rust tests, CLI update e2e, routed-[FIPS] Docker e2e, and safe-MTU Docker e2e before publishing artifacts
- publishes CLI archives for Apple Silicon macOS, Windows x64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64
- publishes Apple Silicon macOS as a signed/notarized DMG plus `.app.tar.gz` updater archive when signing is configured
- publishes Linux x64 `.deb`, Windows x64 setup `.exe`, and signed Android arm64 APK/AAB artifacts
- requires platform signing/package secrets before release app artifacts can publish
- generates its GitHub release notes in the workflow; local `scripts/local-release.mjs` release notes include the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section for the tag
