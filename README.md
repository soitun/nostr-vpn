## Overview

`nostr-vpn` is a Rust workspace for a Tailscale-style mesh VPN control plane built on Nostr signaling and userspace WireGuard. It includes the `nvpn` CLI plus a Tauri/Svelte app codebase that targets desktop and mobile platforms.

</p>

It currently ships:

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `nvpn` | Main CLI for config, daemon lifecycle, networking, diagnostics, and tunnel sessions |
| `nostr-vpn-gui` | Tauri + Svelte GUI app for desktop releases plus Android/iOS targets |
| `nostr-vpn-relay` | Minimal local websocket relay used for integration and e2e testing |
| `nvpn-reflector` | Minimal UDP reflector used for NAT discovery and hole-punch testing |
| `nostr-vpn-core` | Shared library for config, signaling, NAT helpers, diagnostics, MagicDNS, and WireGuard helpers |

## Protocol

For the current protocol-level description of invites, signaling, admin roster sync, relay fallback, NAT traversal, and the WireGuard data plane, see [docs/protocol.md](docs/protocol.md).

## Platform status

| Platform | Current status |
| --- | --- |
| Apple Silicon macOS | Signed desktop app in releases, plus a CLI tarball |
| Windows x64 | Desktop installer and CLI zip in releases; a manual GitHub Actions smoke workflow builds both CLI and GUI |
| Android arm64 | APK/AAB artifacts built in the release workflow |
| iOS | Public TestFlight beta, plus checked-in Tauri mobile code, Packet Tunnel integration, and generated Apple project files |
| Linux | CLI-focused today: release CLI tarballs plus Docker e2e coverage, but no packaged desktop app release |

## What the project does today

- Generates both Nostr identity keys and WireGuard keys automatically
- Stores a single app config with one or more named networks, each with participant allowlists and its own stable mesh ID
- Publishes and consumes private peer announcements over Nostr relays
- Brings up userspace WireGuard tunnels via `boringtun`
- Tracks peer endpoints, including NAT-discovered public endpoints and hole-punch attempts
- Supports route advertisement and exit-node selection
- Exposes JSON status, relay checks, network diagnostics, and doctor bundles
- Includes a desktop GUI with service-first session control, invite QR/import flows, tray integration, autostart, timed LAN pairing, MagicDNS controls, health reporting, and port-mapping status
- Includes Linux-focused Docker e2e coverage for signaling, mesh formation, NAT traversal, and exit-node routing

## Default relays

Used when a config does not specify its own relay list:

- `wss://temp.iris.to`
- `wss://relay.damus.io`
- `wss://relay.snort.social`
- `wss://relay.primal.net`

## Config model

By default, `nvpn` uses the OS config directory:

- Linux: `~/.config/nvpn/config.toml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/nvpn/config.toml`
- Fallback when no config dir is available: `./nvpn.toml`

`nvpn init` creates that file if it does not exist and generates keys automatically.

The config contains:

- global app settings such as autoconnect, tray behavior, and MagicDNS suffix
- Nostr settings including relay URLs and identity keys
- NAT settings including STUN servers, reflectors, and discovery timeout
- node settings including endpoint, tunnel IP, listen port, and advertised routes
- a `[[networks]]` list of named participant sets with one active network at a time

Each `[[networks]]` entry carries its own `network_id`, which is the mesh identity used for private signaling and auto-derived tunnel addressing. If an older config still only has the legacy top-level default, `nostr-vpn` promotes it into per-network stable IDs and then stops recomputing them on participant changes.

Nodes that should talk to each other must share the same `network_id` and list each other as participants. Only the active network participates in the live runtime; inactive networks stay saved for later activation.

## Build and validate

Prerequisites:

- Rust stable
- Node 22 + `corepack`/`pnpm` for the GUI
- OS permissions to create tunnel interfaces when running real sessions
- On Linux Docker e2e: Docker with Compose and `/dev/net/tun`

CI currently runs:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm --dir crates/nostr-vpn-gui install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir crates/nostr-vpn-gui build

cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --exclude nostr-vpn-gui --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --exclude nostr-vpn-gui
```

Additional automation:

- `.github/workflows/windows-smoke.yml` can manually build the Windows CLI and GUI on `windows-latest`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` publishes Apple Silicon macOS, Windows x64, and Android arm64 APK/AAB app artifacts, links the iOS public TestFlight beta, and publishes CLI archives for Apple Silicon macOS, Windows x64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64
- `scripts/publish-zapstore-android.sh` builds a signed Android APK locally and publishes it with `zsp` using `zapstore.yaml`
- `scripts/local-release.mjs` builds local release artifacts, stages a hashtree-style release directory, can publish it to `releases/nostr-vpn`, and can hand the signed Android APK off to Zapstore

### Local release

Typical flow:

```bash
cp .env.release.example .env.release.local
cp .env.zapstore.example .env.zapstore.local
$EDITOR .env.release.local
$EDITOR .env.zapstore.local
node scripts/local-release.mjs --publish --publish-zapstore
```

Notes:

- `.env.release.local` is local-only and gitignored
- the script auto-loads `.env.release.local` and `.env.zapstore.local` when present
- shell environment variables override values from those files
- on Apple Silicon macOS it can build the macOS app/CLI locally, Android APK/AAB when the Android toolchain is configured, and Windows artifacts through a running Parallels VM
- Linux desktop release artifacts are x64 by default and should be built on native amd64 Linux; Docker/QEMU on Apple Silicon currently crashes `rustc`. Set `NVPN_LINUX_DOCKER_PLATFORM=linux/arm64` only when intentionally building optional ARM64 Linux artifacts.
- add `--publish-zapstore` or set `NVPN_PUBLISH_ZAPSTORE=1` when the release should also publish the signed Android APK to Zapstore
- Windows VM selection can be forced with `NVPN_WINDOWS_VM_NAME`; otherwise the script auto-detects a single running Windows guest
- by default it runs the same frontend build, `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` verification steps as the release workflow
- staged local release notes include the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section for the release tag, so update `CHANGELOG.md` before publishing
- omit `--publish` if you only want staged release metadata under the local temp directory

### Publish Android to Zapstore

The repo includes a committed [`zapstore.yaml`](zapstore.yaml) plus a local-only env template in `.env.zapstore.example`.

Android-only local flow:

```bash
cp .env.zapstore.example .env.zapstore.local
$EDITOR .env.zapstore.local
./scripts/publish-zapstore-android.sh
```

Notes:

- the main release flow can reuse an already-built signed APK via `node scripts/local-release.mjs --publish --publish-zapstore`
- the publish script reads signing config from the shell environment or `.env.zapstore.local`
- it stops with a clear error if no signing env is present
- set either `SIGN_WITH` directly or `NOSTR_KEY_PATH` for the Nostr signer
- set `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PATH`, `ANDROID_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, and `ANDROID_KEY_PASSWORD`, and optionally `ANDROID_KEY_ALIAS`
- if the keystore path does not exist yet, the script creates it locally
- the first publish path also uses `nak` to send the signed APK certificate proof to `wss://relay.zapstore.dev`
- Android signing secrets are written only to a temporary `key.properties` file during the build and then removed
- the script defaults to non-interactive `zsp` publishing; set `ZSP_AUTO_CONFIRM=0` or `ZSP_SKIP_PREVIEW=0` if you explicitly want the interactive prompts back
- set `SKIP_PUBLISH=1` to stop after the local signed APK build and validation steps
- set `INSTALL_ON_DEVICE=1` to install the APK over `adb`
- set `CAPTURE_SCREENSHOT=1` to save a screenshot to `artifacts/android/nostr-vpn-home.png`

If you touch the Tauri shell:

```bash
cargo check -p nostr-vpn-gui
```

If you only want the CLI and test binaries:

```bash
cargo build -p nostr-vpn-cli -p nostr-vpn-relay
```

## Install `nvpn`

Latest releases publish CLI archives for Apple Silicon macOS, Windows x64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64. The quick installer below auto-detects only Apple Silicon macOS and Linux:

```bash
case "$(uname -s)/$(uname -m)" in
  Darwin/arm64) ASSET=nvpn-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz ;;
  Linux/x86_64) ASSET=nvpn-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz ;;
  Linux/aarch64|Linux/arm64) ASSET=nvpn-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz ;;
  Darwin/x86_64)
    echo "No prebuilt Intel macOS release is currently published. Build from source or use an older release." >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Unsupported platform: $(uname -s)/$(uname -m)" >&2
    exit 1
    ;;
esac
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/mmalmi/nostr-vpn/releases/latest/download/${ASSET}" | tar -xz && cd nvpn && ./install.sh
```

That command supports Apple Silicon macOS and Linux. On Intel macOS it exits with a clear message. The installer creates the target directory when needed and defaults to `/opt/homebrew/bin` on Apple Silicon macOS when that location exists or is already in `PATH`; otherwise it uses `/usr/local/bin`.

The quick-install line still points at GitHub until a verified `releases/nostr-vpn/latest` tree is published on hashtree. `htree release publish` already maintains the `latest` alias automatically; the missing step is publishing the release tree and verifying the public `upload.iris.to/<npub>/releases/nostr-vpn/latest/...` paths.

On Windows, download the `nvpn-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip` release asset and run `nvpn.exe`, or build from source.

From source:

```bash
cargo install --path crates/nostr-vpn-cli --bin nvpn
```

This is the supported route on Intel macOS.

If you already have a release tarball, extract it and run:

```bash
./install.sh
```

You can also pass a custom destination directory, for example `./install.sh ~/.local/bin`.

## CLI quickstart

Create or refresh config and generate keys:

```bash
nvpn init \
  --participant npub1...alice \
  --participant npub1...bob
```

Adjust persisted settings if needed:

```bash
nvpn set \
  --relay ws://127.0.0.1:8080 \
  --endpoint 192.0.2.10:51820 \
  --tunnel-ip 10.44.0.10/32
```

Run a full foreground session:

```bash
nvpn connect
```

Shorter lifecycle commands:

```bash
nvpn up
nvpn down
```

Daemonized flow used by the GUI:

```bash
nvpn start --daemon --connect
nvpn pause
nvpn resume
nvpn stop
```

For persistent privileged startup:

```bash
sudo nvpn service install
nvpn service status
```

On Windows, run `nvpn service install` from an elevated shell instead of using `sudo`.

The service implementation targets:

- macOS via `launchd`
- Linux via `systemd`
- Windows via the Service Control Manager (`sc.exe`)

`nvpn service enable` / `nvpn service disable` are currently implemented only on macOS. On Linux and Windows, `install` / `uninstall` handle the persistent service lifecycle directly.

Inspect runtime state:

```bash
nvpn status --json
nvpn netcheck --json
nvpn doctor --json
```

Write a support bundle:

```bash
nvpn doctor --write-bundle /tmp/nvpn-doctor
```

Advertise routes or use an exit node:

```bash
nvpn set --advertise-routes 10.0.0.0/24,192.168.0.0/24
nvpn set --advertise-exit-node true
nvpn set --exit-node npub1...peer
```

Clear exit-node selection:

```bash
nvpn set --exit-node off
```

Lower-level commands:

- `announce`
- `listen`
- `render-wg`
- `keygen`
- `init`
- `nat-discover`
- `hole-punch`
- `ping`
- `ip`
- `whois`

## GUI app

The GUI lives in [`crates/nostr-vpn-gui`](crates/nostr-vpn-gui). It is the Tauri/Svelte app codebase for the shipped desktop app, the Android build, and the in-repo iOS target.

The commands below are the desktop flow. Android and iOS use Tauri mobile tooling and the platform-specific code under `src-tauri/`.

Run it in development:

```bash
corepack enable
pnpm --dir crates/nostr-vpn-gui install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir crates/nostr-vpn-gui tauri:dev
```

Build a packaged app:

```bash
pnpm --dir crates/nostr-vpn-gui tauri:build
```

Notes:

- `tauri:dev` and `tauri:build` automatically prepare an `nvpn` sidecar binary for desktop targets
- on desktop, the frontend shells out to `nvpn`; mobile targets use the in-app platform-specific VPN runtime code
- the desktop app is service-first on supported platforms: install the background service first, then use the app for normal on/off control
- the GUI exposes network membership, invite QR/import flows, relay state, session health, MagicDNS, exit-node selection, advertised routes, timed LAN pairing, LAN discovery, autostart, and tray controls
- tagged releases currently publish Apple Silicon macOS, Windows x64, and Android arm64 app artifacts, plus the public TestFlight link for iOS
- iOS builds are distributed through App Store Connect/TestFlight rather than GitHub release artifacts

You can override which CLI binary the GUI uses with `NVPN_CLI_PATH`.

## Local relay and NAT test binaries

For local integration testing:

Run a websocket relay:

```bash
cargo run -p nostr-vpn-relay --bin nostr-vpn-relay -- --bind 127.0.0.1:8080
```

Run a UDP reflector:

```bash
cargo run -p nostr-vpn-relay --bin nvpn-reflector -- --bind 127.0.0.1:3478
```

The reflector is used by `nvpn nat-discover` and `nvpn hole-punch` in local and Docker e2e setups.

## Docker end-to-end coverage

Docker e2e scripts under [`scripts/`](scripts):

- `./scripts/e2e-docker.sh`
  Verifies relay connectivity, `announce`/`listen`, manual `tunnel-up`, and ping across two containers.
- `./scripts/e2e-connect-docker.sh`
  Verifies config-driven `nvpn connect`, mesh formation, relay pause-on-mesh-ready behavior, and tunnel ping.
- `./scripts/e2e-active-network-docker.sh`
  Verifies that inactive saved networks do not change the active mesh identity, expected peer count, or auto-derived tunnel IP.
- `./scripts/e2e-divergent-roster-docker.sh`
  Verifies that peers with a shared mesh ID can still connect when one node has extra configured participants.
- `./scripts/e2e-nat-docker.sh`
  Verifies daemon mode across separate Docker NATs, public endpoint discovery, handshake success, and ping.
- `./scripts/e2e-exit-node-docker.sh`
  Verifies exit-node advertisement, selection, tunnel traffic to the chosen exit node, and default-route traffic crossing the exit path to an external target. Set `NVPN_EXIT_NODE_E2E_PUBLIC_IP=9.9.9.9` (or another reachable public IP) to also prove a real internet hop routes through the tunnel.
- `./scripts/e2e-tauri-driver-docker.sh`
  Builds the GUI in a Linux container, runs the Tauri-driver GUI smoke plus invite join-request regression flow, and writes screenshots to `artifacts/screenshots/`.

These flows are Linux-oriented because they require real tunnel devices and container networking privileges.

## Release workflow notes

Release workflow ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)):

- runs on pushed `v*` tags or manual dispatch
- verifies frontend build, formatting, clippy, and tests before publishing artifacts
- publishes CLI archives for Apple Silicon macOS, Windows x64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64
- publishes Apple Silicon macOS as `nostr-vpn-<version>-macos-arm64.zip` containing a signed, notarized `Nostr VPN.app`
- publishes Windows x64 as `nostr-vpn-<version>-windows-x64-setup.exe`
- publishes Android arm64 release artifacts as APK/AAB files
- links the iOS public TestFlight beta; iOS builds are distributed through App Store Connect/TestFlight rather than GitHub release artifacts
- requires the macOS signing and notarization secrets to be configured before a release can publish the macOS app
- generates its GitHub release notes in the workflow; local `scripts/local-release.mjs` release notes include the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section for the tag
