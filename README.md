`nostr-vpn` is a Tailscale-style private mesh VPN built around a [FIPS]-backed data plane. It includes the `nvpn` CLI/daemon, a shared native app core, and native shells for desktop and mobile platforms.

Release artifacts currently cover native Apple Silicon macOS, Linux x64, Windows x64, Android arm64, StartOS x86_64/aarch64 service packages, and headless CLI archives for Apple Silicon macOS, Windows x64, Linux x86_64, and Linux arm64. Intel macOS is source-only for now.

## Quick Start

```bash
cargo install nvpn --force
nvpn init
MY_NPUB='<paste nostr_pubkey from nvpn init>'
nvpn set --participant "$MY_NPUB"
nvpn start --daemon --connect
```

On a new device, generate its signed join request and show it to an admin in a Nostr VPN app:

```bash
nvpn init
nvpn join-request
```

The admin scans or pastes that request. Approval returns an admin-signed roster to the joining device. This signed request is the only join flow.

For the background daemon flow used by desktop apps:

```bash
nvpn start --daemon --connect
nvpn status
nvpn stop
```

For persistent startup:

```bash
sudo nvpn service install
nvpn service status
```

On Windows, run `nvpn service install` from an elevated shell instead of using `sudo`.

## Native Apps

The native apps share the Rust app-core state/action contract and use platform shells for macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS.

```bash
just build
just run
```

Use `just run-macos` or `just run-linux` when you want a specific desktop target.

## What Works Today

- Generates Nostr identity keys automatically
- Enrolls devices through signed join requests and admin-signed roster delivery
- Stores multiple named networks with one active network at a time
- Brings up [FIPS] private mesh tunnels for private network traffic
- Routes private traffic directly when possible and through [FIPS] neighbors when direct UDP is blocked
- Supports MagicDNS, authenticated DNS-over-HTTPS for exit routes, route advertisement, exit-node selection, and WireGuard upstream egress
- Exposes native desktop apps, JSON status, network diagnostics, doctor bundles, desktop updates, and Linux-focused Docker e2e coverage

## Platform Status

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Apple Silicon macOS | Native SwiftUI/AppKit app, CLI tarball, signed/notarized release artifacts when credentials are configured |
| Linux x64 | Native GTK/libadwaita app, `.deb`, CLI tarballs, Docker e2e coverage |
| Windows x64 | Native WPF app, installer, CLI zip, WinTun tunnel path |
| Android arm64 | Native app-core UI, signed APK/AAB artifacts when signing is configured, VPN runtime still being hardened |
| iOS | Native SwiftUI app and NetworkExtension target available on the App Store; public TestFlight beta remains available |
| Umbrel / StartOS | Web control panels and service packages |
| Intel macOS | Source-only |

## Maintainer Notes

This section is intentionally compact and command-oriented. Keep user-facing product detail above; keep agent/operator reference material here.

### Config Model

`nvpn init` creates the config and keys automatically. By default, config lives in the OS app config directory:

- Linux: `~/.config/nvpn/config.toml`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/nvpn/config.toml`
- Fallback when no config dir is available: `./nvpn.toml`

The config contains global app settings, Nostr relay/identity settings, NAT settings, node settings, and a `[[networks]]` list. Each network has its own stable `network_id`; only the active network participates in the live runtime.

### Validation

Normal Rust gate:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
```

Per-change core/contract verification:

```bash
just verify-fast
```

Managed native preflight and the nightly/release five-platform matrix:

```bash
just verify-health
just verify-full
```

See [verification tiers and managed native lab](docs/verification-tiers.md).

Release gate before version bumps and tags:

```bash
just release-gate
```

The gate overlaps its resource-isolated Windows and Docker-build lanes with
host validation, writes each lane to `artifacts/release-gate-logs`, and reuses
one candidate Docker image across functional and performance checks. NAT and
the kernel/userspace WireGuard fixtures also overlap on isolated subnets.
Roaming, throughput, host-pair, physical-device, and idle-CPU measurements
remain serial so concurrency cannot skew their results.

Useful focused checks:

```bash
pnpm --dir web/control-panel check
( cd linux && cargo check )
NVPN_E2E_ROAMING_SCENARIOS=latency ./scripts/e2e-fips-roaming-docker.sh
```

Run the Windows build from a checkout on the configured Windows dev VM:

```powershell
dotnet build windows\NostrVpn.Windows\NostrVpn.Windows.csproj -p:EnableWindowsTargeting=true
```

### Packages and E2E

- StartOS package: [`startos`](startos)
- Umbrel package: [`umbrel`](umbrel)
- Umbrel local web check:

```bash
docker compose -f umbrel/docker-compose.local.yml up --build
just e2e-umbrel-web
```

Focused security regression kit:

```bash
just security-regressions
```

Docker e2e and desktop updater scripts live under [`scripts`](scripts). The most common entrypoints are `scripts/e2e-docker.sh`, `scripts/e2e-fips-routed-udp-docker.sh`, `scripts/e2e-fips-nat-safe-mtu-docker.sh`, `scripts/e2e-wireguard-exit-docker.sh`, and `scripts/e2e-update-desktop.sh`.

### Release

1. Move `CHANGELOG.md` from `## Unreleased` to `## X.Y.Z - YYYY-MM-DD`.
2. Bump the root `[workspace.package].version` in `Cargo.toml`.
3. Run `node scripts/sync-versions.mjs` and verify with `node scripts/sync-versions.mjs --check`.
4. Run `just release-gate`.
5. Commit, create `git tag vX.Y.Z`, push the tag to `github`, and push `master` to both `github` and htree `origin`.
6. Watch `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

For local artifact staging, use:

```bash
cp .env.release.example .env.release.local
$EDITOR .env.release.local
just release-publish
```
