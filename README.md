`nostr-vpn` is a Tailscale-style private mesh VPN with a data plane powered by [our independently evolved FIPS implementation](https://github.com/mmalmi/fips), based on the [original FIPS project](https://github.com/jmcorgan/fips). It also includes an experimental marketplace for byte-metered public exit nodes paid in Bitcoin through Cashu.

Nostr identities and signed rosters control enrollment; peers connect directly when possible and route through FIPS neighbors when direct UDP is unavailable. MagicDNS, subnet routes, exit nodes, and WireGuard upstream egress are built in. The project includes the `nvpn` CLI and daemon plus native apps for macOS, Linux, Windows, Android, and iOS.

The fork is optimized for high-rate VPN traffic. In comparable direct-path benchmarks it delivers roughly three times the original implementation's throughput by keeping packet ownership, buffers, and session state together, batching I/O and cryptography, reusing packet storage, and avoiding packet-by-packet queue hops, allocations, copies, and repeated lookups. It preserves the FIPS protocol surface.

## Install

- Desktop apps and CLI archives: [git.iris.to releases](https://git.iris.to/#/npub1xdhnr9mrv47kkrn95k6cwecearydeh8e895990n3acntwvmgk2dsdeeycm/nostr-vpn?tab=releases) or the [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/mmalmi/nostr-vpn/releases/latest)
- CLI: `cargo install nvpn`
- iOS: [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/nostr-vpn/id6785410348) or [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/58sg4agv)
- Android: APK from the releases above or [Zapstore](https://zapstore.dev/apps/org.nostrvpn.app)
- Servers: signed [StartOS (Start9)](startos) `.s9pk` packages in the releases above, plus a multi-architecture [Umbrel](umbrel) image and app bundle

Desktop apps target Apple Silicon macOS and x64 Linux/Windows; mobile builds target arm64, and CLI archives also cover Linux arm64. StartOS and Umbrel support x86_64/amd64 and arm64. Intel macOS is source-only.

On Debian or Ubuntu, building the CLI with Cargo requires `pkg-config` and
`libdbus-1-dev` (`sudo apt install pkg-config libdbus-1-dev`). The prebuilt CLI
archives do not require these development packages.

## CLI Quick Start

Create a network on the first device:

```bash
nvpn init
DEVICE_ID='<paste nostr_pubkey from nvpn init>'
nvpn set --device "$DEVICE_ID"
nvpn start --daemon --connect
```

On another device, start its daemon, generate a signed join request, and scan or paste the request into an admin's Nostr VPN app:

```bash
nvpn init
nvpn start --daemon --connect
nvpn join-request
```

The daemon lifecycle is:

```bash
nvpn start --daemon --connect
nvpn status
nvpn stop
```

For startup at boot, run `sudo nvpn service install`; on Windows, run `nvpn service install` from an elevated shell. Check it with `nvpn service status`.

## Paid Exits

Buy or sell VPN bandwidth for Bitcoin. Providers advertise per-byte prices over Nostr; buyers fund a Cashu Spilman payment channel and send signed payment updates as they use bandwidth. Uploads are billed as sent, UDP downloads only for replies to your traffic, and TCP downloads only once acknowledged, without double-counting retransmissions.

Choose a provider manually or let the app select based on connection quality, trusted ratings, and price.

DNS is encrypted by default. Exit providers can still see destination IPs and unencrypted traffic, so use HTTPS for sensitive data. See the [protocol](docs/protocol.md#paid-exits) for payment and privacy details.

## Build and Verify

```bash
just build
just run
just verify-fast
```

Use `just run-macos` or `just run-linux` for a specific desktop target. See [verification tiers](docs/verification-tiers.md) for broader native, integration, and release checks.
